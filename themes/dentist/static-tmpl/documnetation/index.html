    	<h1>Directory Structure</h1>
    	<hr/>
    	<p>The files directory structure is easy to follow. Following is the snippnet of the files directory.</p>
    	<p><img src="img/directory-snippet.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
    	<p>The files are organized in an easy to follow directory structure and the names of the directories and files are self-explanatory. All the images used as inside the images directory. Similarly all the Javascript files, css files and phpmailer files are in their respective directories. All the html files an at the root directory.</p>

  <div class="margin-bottom">
    	<h1>HTML Structure</h1>
    	<hr/>
    	<p>Dentologist is build modularly i.e. it is easy to move one section from one page to another. Each HTML file is properly commented divided into sections. Each Section have starting and ending comments so that it is easy to customize and interchange sections from one page to another.</p>
    	<p>Following is the convention used in the HTML files</p>
    	<pre>
    		&lt;html&gt;
    		&lt;head&gt;
    		All the css files are included here along with page title and meta tags
    		&lt;/head&gt;
    		&lt;body&gt;
    		Every Section Starts and Ends with a comment. For example header section starts and ends with the following Comments
    		&lt;!--header section starts here--&gt;
    		.
    		.
    		.
    		&lt;!--header section ends here--&gt;
    		&lt;/body&gt;
    		&lt;/html&gt;
    	</pre>
    	
    	<p>Every file uses the same convention defined above. If you intend to move a section from one page to another simply copy the section from its starting comment to ending tag and you are done.</p>
